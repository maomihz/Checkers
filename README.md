# MaomiHz's project

### Introduction

This is a project for University of California Berkeley's Summer program. This is project 1. The game is a checker game with graphical user interface.

If you are in the same class, please __DO NOT__ copy my code. Writing the code is fun, so don't ruin the fun. 

### Class List

 - `Board.java` The main class, which is the observer of the whole game. 
 - `DemoBoard.java` I actually want to turn this class into a tic-tac-toe!
 - `Piece.java` Just a normal piece...
 - `ShieldPiece.java` That's a extension for the normal piece. Will not be blown up by BombPiece.
 - `BombPiece.java` Extension for the normal piece. When capturing, blown up.
 - `StdDrawPlus.java` The graphical interface toolkit, adapted from Stanford. No credit for me. 

### Build and run

 - Clone this project with `git clone`
